    <h2>SteamVision can help.</h2>
    <p>Over the years, your Steam account has filled up with games you played and loved. But maybe it's got some others
        too: gems you purchased on sale or in a bundle and never got around to playing. SteamVision lets you sort
        through them all and find the game that's just what you were looking for.</p>

                <p>It's not necessarily the username you use to log in. Go to your Steam Community profile page and
                    copy either the entire URL (http://steamcommunity.com/id/[STEAMID]/) or just the ID part. It
                    will either be a string of numbers or whatever profile URL you've chosen. SteamVision also accepts
                    Steam IDs which look like "STEAM_0:1:23456789".</p>
