# SteamVision
#### Browse your Steam library in a more informative way.

Over the years, your Steam account has filled up with games you played and loved. But maybe it's got some others too: 
gems you purchased on sale or in a bundle and never got around to playing. SteamVision lets you sort through them all 
and find the game that's just what you were looking for.

SteamVision is my final project for Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu) course. It is currently hosted on Heroku 
at [steam.vision](http://www.steam.vision). 

For instructions on using SteamVision, have a look at [documentation.txt](./documentation.txt). For a description of 
how it works, check out [design.txt](./design.txt).
